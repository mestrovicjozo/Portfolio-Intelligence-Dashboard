# Product Requirements Document: Portfolio Intelligence Dashboard

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for a Portfolio Intelligence Dashboard. The application will allow users to track their stock portfolio, gather relevant news and articles, and ask natural language questions to gain insights into their investments. The system will leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) for sentiment analysis and to provide answers to user queries.

## 2. Problem Statement

Investors today are inundated with financial data and news. It is difficult and time-consuming to manually track a portfolio, stay up-to-date with relevant information, and understand the underlying reasons for market movements. This application aims to solve this by providing a centralized dashboard that not only displays portfolio information but also offers intelligent, AI-powered insights.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

*   **Goal:** To create a powerful, intuitive, and easy-to-use tool for investors to monitor and understand their stock portfolios.
*   **Objectives:**
    *   Develop a user-friendly interface for selecting and tracking stocks.
    *   Integrate with a financial data provider (Alpha Vantage) to fetch real-time and historical stock data and news articles.
    *   Implement an AI-powered backend that can analyze news sentiment and answer user questions in natural language.
    *   Ensure the application is easy to set up and run for other developers.

## 4. Target Audience

*   **Retail Investors:** Individuals managing their own portfolios who want a deeper understanding of their investments.
*   **Financial Analysts:** Professionals who need to quickly gather and analyze information about specific stocks or market sectors.
*   **Hobbyist Developers:** Technologists interested in financial markets and AI applications.

## 5. Features & Requirements

### 5.1. Frontend

*   **Stock Selection:**
    *   Users must be able to search for and select individual stocks to add to their portfolio.
    *   The application should provide an option to add pre-determined sets of stocks, such as the S&P 500.
*   **Dashboard:**
    *   A main dashboard to display the user's portfolio, including stock prices, daily changes, and other relevant metrics.
    *   A section to display recent news and articles related to the user's portfolio.
*   **Query Interface:**
    *   A chat-like interface where users can ask questions about their portfolio in natural language.
    *   The interface should display the answers generated by the backend LLM.

### 5.2. Backend

*   **Data Ingestion:**
    *   The backend will fetch stock prices and news articles from the Alpha Vantage API.
*   **Database:**
    *   A relational database will be used to store structured data such as stock prices, historical data, and calculated sentiment scores.
    *   A vector database will be used to store embeddings of news articles for semantic search and question-answering.
*   **AI/LLM Integration:**
    *   An LLM will be used to perform the following tasks:
        *   Generate embeddings for news articles to be stored in the vector database.
        *   Calculate a sentiment score for each article.
        *   Interpret and answer user questions by querying the relational and vector databases.

### 5.3. Question Answering

The system should be able to answer questions like:

*   "Why are my quantum computing stocks rising this week?"
*   "Compare the sentiment between Microsoft and Tesla."
*   "What are the latest news articles about my technology stocks?"

## 6. Development and Deployment

*   **Version Control:** The development process will involve modular and incremental commits to a Git repository to ensure a clear and trackable history of changes.
*   **Setup and Installation:**
    *   The project must include a detailed `README.md` file with clear, step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment and running the application.
    *   This should include instructions on how to install dependencies, set up the databases, and configure API keys (e.g., for Alpha Vantage and the chosen LLM).

## 7. Assumptions and Missing Information

This document is based on the initial prompt. The following items need to be defined:

*   **Specific Technologies:**
    *   **Relational Database:** A specific relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL) needs to be chosen.
    *   **Vector Database:** A specific vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Chroma, FAISS) needs to be chosen.
    *   **Large Language Model (LLM):** A specific LLM (e.g., from OpenAI, Google, or an open-source model) needs to be selected.
    *   **Frontend Framework:** A specific frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) needs to be chosen.
    *   **Backend Framework:** A specific backend framework (e.g., FastAPI, Express.js, Django) needs to be chosen.
*   **User Interface (UI) Design:** Detailed UI mockups and a design system are needed to guide frontend development.
*   **Authentication:** The current plan does not include user authentication. The application will be for a single user on a local machine. Multi-user support could be a future enhancement.
*   **Deployment:** The initial focus is on local setup. A deployment strategy for making the application accessible over the internet (e.g., using Docker, deploying to a cloud provider) is not yet defined.
